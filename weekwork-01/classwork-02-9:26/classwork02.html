			<p> Hello. My name is Emma Nelson. I graduated high school in 2016. Since then I decided to take a gap year and travel to a few different places and experience some of the amazing things that life has to offer. I spent a year living in Colorado where i tought snowbaording in Breckenridge. I also went to Hawaii for a month where i was able to experience what it was like to be an organic sustainable farmer for a few weeks. Recently, I have moved back to my home town of Austin, TX where I have started a Coding Bootcamp at the University of Texas. Please feel free to view my portfolio at this link <a class="redlink" href="#"> This Link </a></p>
